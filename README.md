# Portfolio

The goal is to use this portfolio site to not only showcase my experience, but to enhance the page with features and functionality over time.

### v2.1 
Finally moved onto my own domain at [hogan.work](https://www.hogan.work), currently powered by Cloudflare Pages! Given that I'm not using any build tools, deployment is virtually identical and take no time at all.

### v2
Simplified projects and moved to a CSS Grid card powered by container queries. 
Added versions.html to share my progress.

### v1.3
Projects now include CSS scroll animations


### v1.2
Projects now feature CSS frosted glass effect


### v1.1
Replaced Bootstrap with Barebones CSS framework for styling and Swiper.js for sliders


### v1
HTML/CSS with Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and Video.js
